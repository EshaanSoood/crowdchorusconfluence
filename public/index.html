        <p>Crowd Chorus Confluence is an endeavour started by Eshaan Sood to help musicians starting out with the nitty gritty of the music business. Things like scouting for venues, emails, location management, rehearsal coordination can take up a lot of time. Our goal with Crowd Chorus Confluence is to help artists build communities while saving them time  so that they can focus on the music.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question"><span class="faq-q">Q:</span> What all can you help me do?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">We can help you strategise and brainstorm various ideas to help with growth strategies. This includes things like helping you scout for appropriate venues, helping you organise your own shows, managing bookings for rehearsal spaces and recording studios, hiring talent  such as photographers and videographers.  Honestly there are some things we cannot do for you but the rest is all fair game.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question"><span class="faq-q">Q:</span> So what can you not do for us?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">Well first we can't take you from no fans to sold out shows overnight. And secondly we cannot make the music or handle your social media for you, though we're happy to recommend people who would be willing to work with you on that. The easy way to think about it is, if it involves you talking to any other business. or person we can help with that. If it is related to your own artistic vision, we're happy to talk and offer our opinion but that is something we leave to the artists. Artists gotta art.</p>
